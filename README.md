🔥 What's Coming After Exam (Planned Features)

Feature	Details
Admin Panel	Build Django/Flask admin dashboard to control website contents. Add/Edit/Delete Home, About, Services, Contact, FAQ pages without touching code.
MongoDB Database	Store all website data (text, services list, FAQ questions) in MongoDB. Pull dynamically on each page load.
Content Management System (CMS)	Allow easy management of website texts, images, services, FAQs through Admin panel.
Dynamic Routing	Each service/FAQ entry could have its own dynamic page (optional).
Authentication (Optional)	Secure admin panel login with username/password authentication.
SEO Optimization	Add meta tags for Google search ranking (title, description, keywords).
Performance Optimization	Minify CSS, lazy load images, optimize animations for faster load times.
Deployment	Host the project live on a production server (like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel).
Auto Email System (Optional)	When someone submits a contact form, send an auto-reply and notify admin via email.
⚙️ How It Will Work With MongoDB and Admin Panel

Component	How It Works
Pages (Home, About, etc.)	Text, images, service descriptions will be stored in MongoDB collections.
Admin Panel	Forms in the Admin Panel allow editing the Home, About, Services, Contact, FAQ data.
Templates	Templates like home.html, about.html, etc. will render content dynamically from database.
API	Flask/Django views will query MongoDB and pass data to templates.
Contact Form	Submissions will be stored in MongoDB and (optional) emailed to the admin.
🌐 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (only for animations), Font Awesome

Backend: (planned) Python Flask / Django

Database: MongoDB (planned)

Admin Panel: Django Admin or Custom Flask Admin
